    REGEX TESTING CASES:
    - multiple countries can be found after place of origin and 'region or state e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_bread , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger
    - origins may not be country specific and be a larger inclusive region e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biryani https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawarma
    - origins may not be country specific and be oddly named instead i.e. an old country that doesn't exist e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous
    - multi-origin foods:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_con_carne
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fajita
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savory_spinach_pie does not return first listed origin due to alphabetical order properties
    - place of origin might instead be a description https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceviche
    - place of origin references continent and not country https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jollof_rice , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flan_(pie)
    - certain food titles might return information on something else with the same e.g. ratatouille returns information on ratatouille the MOVIE: https://api.wikimedia.org/core/v1/wikipedia/en/search/page?q=Ratatouille&limit=5
    - new phrase found: 'Associated Cuisine' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlova_(dessert) , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikan_bakar
    - need to include Britain as UK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd%27s_pie
    - alphabetical bias: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannoli , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_papaya_salad , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8me_br%C3%BBl%C3%A9e , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango_pudding , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clambake , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_kway_teow , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgogi
    - countries may be abbreviated i.e US instead of United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichyssoise
    - a list of 'regional variants' may be included and list a large amount of countries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalebi
    - redirecting may not be enough for certain food items as they might have a page with a large amount of possible links

[
    REGEX TESTING CASES (FIXED):
    - need to accomodate special characters e.gg Bánh mì
        - mostly fixed with redirecting
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgogi returns korea instead of NORTH korea
        - added switch case block to backend algorithm
    - algorithm ends when failing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doner_kebab
        - fixed
    - BOTH  place of origin and 'region or state' can sometimes be present e.g https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazpacho
        - fixed
    - Scotland does not have an independent code because it is not a sovereign state; it is part of the United Kingdom. Therefore, it uses the United Kingdom's country code, GB. + England https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pie
        - converted them to to return 'United Kingdom'
